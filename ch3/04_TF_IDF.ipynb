There is no notion of some words in the document being more important than others. TF-IDF addresses this issue. It aims to quantify the importance of a given word relative to other words in the document and in the corpus. It was commonly used representation scheme for information retrieval systems, for extracting relevant documents from a corpus for given text query. \n","\n","This notebook shows a simple example of how to get the TF-IDF representation of a document using sklearn's TfidfVectorizer.
